Let's get back to the issue of parsing logfiles of analyses of backgammon matches into a datafram in R. Here's an example or such a file. The goal is to have a dataframe with a row for each decision. The dataframe should conntain these columns:

- Player name 1
- Player name 2
- Match length
- Match date
- Math place
- Score player 1
- Score player 2
- Position ID
- Match ID
- Board in text format
- Decision type: Checker play/cube decision
- Turn (player 1 or 2)
- Roll (if checker play)
- Play made
- Size of cube error (if available)
- Size of checker play error (if available)
- Checker play analysis in text format (if available)
- Cube decision analysis in text format (if available)

Suggestion for pseudocode:

1. Extract score, match length and player names from first line using regex
2. Extract date and place from line 4 and 5
3. Split file into list of positons, using "move number:" as separator
4. For each position:
	- Extract Positon ID and Match ID from lines containing "Positon ID" and "Match ID"
	- Extract decision type, turn and possibly roll from first line
	- Extract decision from lines beginning with "*" and containing moves/accepts/doubles/passes
	- Extract board text by concatenating lines containg "GNU Backgammon", "Match ID", "+12", "+13", "|", "Pipcounts:"
	- Extract checker play analysis by concatenating lines beginning with "     " or "*    "
	- Extract cube decision analysis by concatenating lines containing "Cube analysis", "equity", "six numbers", "No double", "Double, pass", "Double, take", "Proper cube action"
	- Extract play made from lines containing "moves", "doubles", "passes"
	- Extract size of checker play error by finding the value in parenthesis at the end of the line, if present
	- Extract size of cube decision error by by checking if the actual action equals the proper cube action
5. Unlist all the positions into a dataframe
6. Pivot longer, so each row becomes two, if it is both a checker play and a cube decision
7. Clean the dataframe, for example by "rolling forward" values like score, match length that may be presents in only one row, and replacing NA errors by 0.
