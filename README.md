# R-package: `backgammon`
This is a collection of useful functions for calculations related to backgammon.

For example, `ggboard()` creates backgammon positions using the `ggplot2` 
package. 

Other functions calculate take points in different flavors, like `tp()` and `tp_gammons()`, or scale a certain match winning probability to equivalent-to-moneygame, `emg()`, in the same way as programs like [eXtreme Gammon](https://www.extremegammon.com/) does.

See the function [references](https://lassehjorthmadsen.github.io/backgammon/reference/index.html) for a full overview.
